# FastAPI Intro

If you're into web development and haven't heard of FastAPI yet, you're in for a treat. FastAPI is like the cool, new kid on the block in the world of Python web frameworks. Here's why it's worth your time:

## What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a modern, fast (hence the name), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+. It's designed to be fast and intuitive, leveraging type hints to boost both performance and developer productivity.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: It's built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, which means it's not just fast, it's lightning fast. We're talking about handling thousands of requests per second with ease.

- **Async Support**: FastAPI supports asynchronous programming out of the box, which is perfect for handling I/O-bound tasks efficiently.

- **Automatic Interactive Documentation**: With FastAPI, you get Swagger UI and ReDoc automatically. This means less work for you in documenting your API.

- **Type Hints**: By using Python's type hints, FastAPI can validate your data, generate documentation, and even serialize/deserialize your data automatically.

- **Standard Python Type System**: This isn't just about validation; it's about making your code more readable and maintainable.

## Why Choose FastAPI?

- **Speed**: If performance is critical for your application, FastAPI is a top contender.

- **Ease of Use**: The syntax is clean and intuitive. If you know Python, you'll pick up FastAPI quickly.

- **Modern**: It's designed with modern Python in mind, leveraging the latest language features.

- **Ecosystem**: It plays nicely with other tools and frameworks, making it versatile for various projects.

## A Simple Example

Here's a quick example to get you started:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```
