          I’m an Indie guy with a passion for learning and exploring the world
          of technology. My journey began with a fascination for machines and
          systems, which has only deepened over time. I’ve discovered that my
          interests lie in machine learning, AI, and web development, and I
          strive to become a polymath, always eager to learn and grow.

          Living with ADHD and dyslexia has shaped my perspective, allowing me
          to approach challenges with creativity and resilience. I embrace the
          things I can do rather than what I can't, focusing on solutions and
          growth. My goal is to help others navigate the complexities of
          technology while avoiding common pitfalls in the process.
        </p>
        <p className="text-pretty">
          Outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, spending time with family, and diving
          into new books. I also have a deep appreciation for music, which
          brings joy and inspiration to my life. I’m always looking for new ways
          to engage with my passions and share them with others.
